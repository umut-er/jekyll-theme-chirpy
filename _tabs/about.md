Hello! I am Umut Utku Er≈üahince. I am majoring in Computer Science in Bilkent University. Here is my [CV](/assets/pdf/UUE-CV.pdf). In this blog, you will be able to find my writings on various subjects.  
The primary purpose of this blog is to document my experience (about mostly technical things) during my 2024 Google Summer of Code process. You can read my [proposal](/assets/pdf/GSoC.pdf) here. However, in the future, I might write about other things including but not limited to computer science, mathematics, my own projects or just personal thoughts.  
You can find my GitHub account and my email in the bottom left, should you want to contact me.
